DESCRIPTION
-----------
This module allows you to create and manipulate data stored in INI-style configuration files.  Not all features of the INI file "standards" are supported, but almost all of the more useful ones are.

There is a simple example program showing how to read an INI file in the inifilehandler.mod\doc directory.  More examples will hopefully be added later.


INSTALLATION
------------
To install this module, extract the contents of the archive into your BlitzMax\mod directory.
