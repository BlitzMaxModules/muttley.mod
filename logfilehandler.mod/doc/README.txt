DESCRIPTION
-----------
This module allows you to create and write date/timestamped messages to one or more log files.  You can specify the level of logging you wish (or change it whilst running) and only messages that fit within that level of logging will be written.  Therefore you can have enhanced logging whilst in Debug mode for example.

Log rotation is supported by disabling overwrite mode and setting a maximum log file size.

There is a simple example program showing how to use this module in the logfilehandler.mod\examples directory.


INSTALLATION
------------
To install this module, extract the contents of the archive into your BlitzMax\mod directory.
